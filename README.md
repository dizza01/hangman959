# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Create a file named milestone_2.py. This file will contain the code for the first milestone.

In Python, Lists are used to store multiple data in a single variable. In this task, we are going to create a list of words.
